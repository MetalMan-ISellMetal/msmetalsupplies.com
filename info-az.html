        <p>
            Aluzinc steel also commonly known as Galvalume is a cold-rolled steel substrate coated with a metallic layer 
            consisting of approximately <Strong>55% aluminum, 43.4% zinc, and 1.6% silicon</Strong>. This coating formulation gives 
            Aluzinc a unique <Strong>balance of corrosion resistance, heat reflectivity, and surface durability</Strong>. The aluminum 
            provides long-term barrier protection, while the zinc offers sacrificial protection along cut edges and 
            scratches. The silicon component enhances the adhesion and uniformity of the coating during production.
        </p>

        <p>
            The combination of metals produces a <Strong>distinctive spangled appearance</Strong>, with a smooth and bright surface that 
            is often used directly in visible applications. Because it is both lightweight and significantly more 
            corrosion-resistant than traditional galvanized steel, Aluzinc has become a <Strong>preferred material for roofing, 
            cladding, and various exterior construction products in tropical climates like Malaysia</Strong>.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <p>
            The manufacturing process begins with cold rolled steel coil, which undergoes cleaning and heat preparation 
            before being immersed in a <Strong>molten bath containing an aluminum-zinc-silicon alloy</Strong>. The bath is tightly 
            controlled at temperatures around 600°C to maintain the precise chemical balance. As the steel exits the 
            bath, air knives regulate the final coating thickness, and the sheet then solidifies to form a durable 
            metallurgical bond.
        </p>

        <p>
            During solidification, <Strong>aluminum forms a continuous barrier layer on the surface, while zinc becomes trapped 
            within the structure</Strong>, creating small pockets of sacrificial protection. This combination ensures long-term 
            corrosion resistance even in aggressive environments, including coastal regions and high-humidity climates.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h2>Corrosion Performance & Protection Mechanism</h2>
        <p>
            Aluzinc steel provides significantly better corrosion resistance than standard galvanized steel, often 
            lasting 2 to 4 times longer depending on the environment. Aluminum in the coating protects the steel by 
            forming a stable oxide layer that slows corrosion dramatically. Meanwhile, the zinc component continues to 
            offer sacrificial protection, particularly at exposed cut edges.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aluzinc benefits from a hybrid mechanism: a long-lasting aluminum barrier and a backup zinc reaction layer. This makes it especially suitable for 
            outdoor applications subjected to <Strong>regular weather exposure or heat cycles</Strong>.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h2>Common Applications</h2>
        
        <p>
            Common applications include <Strong>roofing sheets, wall cladding, decking sheets, gutters, downpipes, electrical 
            cabinets, home appliances, and certain automotive components.</Strong> Industries value Aluzinc for its combination 
            of strength, durability, and clean aesthetic appearance. Its lightweight nature can also reduce structural 
            loads in large roof installations.
        </p>

        <p>
            The high reflectivity of the coating also improves thermal efficiency, making Aluzinc roof sheets a popular 
            choice in buildings aiming for lower heat absorption. Many <Strong>color-coated coils (PPGI/PPGL)</Strong> also use Aluzinc 
            as the base metal due to its excellent surface stability.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
            While Aluzinc excels in most atmospheric environments, <Strong>it is not ideal for strong chemical exposure, animal 
            waste environments, or direct contact with wet cement</Strong>. The aluminum-rich coating may also be less effective 
            for situations requiring highly active sacrificial behavior compared to pure GI.
