    <section class="content">
        <h2>Hot-Dip Galvanizing (GI) – Process Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Hot-dip galvanizing is a long-established method of protecting steel from corrosion by immersing it into a 
            bath of molten zinc at around 450°C. Before entering the zinc bath, the steel is thoroughly cleaned to remove 
            oils, rust, scale, and impurities. During immersion, zinc reacts with the steel surface to form multiple 
            zinc-iron alloy layers, topped with a final layer of pure metallic zinc. These metallurgical layers are tightly 
            bonded, giving GI steel its signature durability and long service life.
        </p>

        <h2>Benefits of GI Coating</h2>
        <p>
            GI steel offers excellent corrosion protection through a combination of barrier protection and sacrificial 
            (cathodic) protection. Even if the coating is scratched, the zinc will corrode in place of the exposed steel, 
            slowing rust formation. This makes GI suitable for outdoor applications, structural work, roofing, fencing, 
            infrastructure, safety barriers, and industrial hardware. A properly applied GI coating can last decades 
            depending on thickness and environment.

    <!-- Section: Electro-Galvanizing -->
    <section class="content">
        <h2>Electro-Galvanizing (EG) – Process Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Electro-galvanizing deposits a thin, extremely uniform layer of pure zinc onto cold-rolled steel using an 
            electrolytic cell. The steel coil passes through a series of zinc ion baths while an electric current causes 
            zinc particles to bond to the metal surface. This allows coating thickness to be controlled with micrometer 
            precision, typically ranging from 3–12 µm. After plating, the material is rinsed, dried, and treated with 
            anti-fingerprint or chromate coatings to improve corrosion resistance.
        </p>

        <h2>Benefits of EG Coating</h2>
        <p>
            EG steel is prized for its exceptionally smooth and bright surface finish. Because the coating is pure zinc 
            without alloy layers, it remains highly ductile and ideal for forming, stamping, or deep-drawing. The surface 
            also bonds extremely well with paint and welds cleanly. These qualities make EG a standard material for 
            automotive panels, electrical enclosures, appliances, cabinets, and precision components.

    <!-- Section: Comparison -->
    <section class="content">
        <h2>GI vs EG – Key Differences</h2>
        <p>
            Although both coatings use zinc for corrosion protection, their properties differ significantly due to their 
            manufacturing processes.

        <h2>Which One Should You Choose?</h2>
        <p>
            If long-term outdoor corrosion protection is the priority, GI is the stronger choice due to its thicker 
            coating and sacrificial behavior. If surface quality, formability, or paint adhesion is crucial, EG is clearly 
            superior. Many manufacturers use both types depending on the product’s function and the environmental 
            conditions.
