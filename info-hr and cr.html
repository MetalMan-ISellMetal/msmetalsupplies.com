    <p>
        Hot rolled steel is produced by heating slabs or billets <Strong>above their recrystallization temperature</Strong> 
        (typically 900–1100°C) and then passing them through a series of reducing rollers. Because the steel 
        is shaped at such high temperatures, it remains <Strong>soft and malleable</Strong>, allowing it to be formed into large 
        structural shapes with ease. The high-temperature process creates a <Strong>rough mill scale surface** and **looser 
        dimensional tolerances</Strong> compared to cold rolled steel.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the steel cools naturally at room temperature after rolling, internal stresses remain low, giving 
        HR steel <Strong>good weldability</Strong> and making it suitable for applications where <Strong>surface appearance is not 
        critical</Strong>. Its low production cost and versatility make it widely used in <Strong>infrastructure, automotive 
        frames, pipes, general fabrication, and heavy machinery</Strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Limitations include <Strong>lower dimensional accuracy and a rougher finish</Strong>, which may require further 
        processing such as <Strong>pickling, cold reduction, or coating</Strong> to improve appearance or performance. Despite 
        this, HR steel is a cost-effective choice for <Strong>heavy-duty applications</Strong> where precision and surface finish 
        are secondary concerns.
    </p>

    <!-- COLD ROLLED SECTION -->
    <h1>Cold Rolled (CR) Steel</h1>

    <!-- Picture placeholders -->
    <div class="image-row">
        <img src="images/cr1.jpg" alt="Cold Rolled Steel Image 1">
        <img src="images/cr2.jpg" alt="Cold Rolled Steel Image 2">
    </div>

    <p>
        Cold rolled steel begins as hot rolled coil which is <Strong>pickled to remove mill scale</Strong>, then passed through 
        rollers at room temperature for further reduction. This improves surface finish, mechanical strength, 
        dimensional accuracy, and uniformity. The material becomes strain-hardened, <Strong>achieving higher yield 
        strength and tighter thickness tolerances</Strong> than HR steel.
    </p>

    <p>
        CR steel offers a <Strong>smooth, clean, and reflective surface</Strong>, making it ideal for high-precision and 
        aesthetic applications. It is commonly used in <strong>home appliances, automotive body panels, electrical 
        panels, office furniture</strong>, and as a <strong>base material</strong> for downstream coatings including electro-galvanizing, 
        galvanneal, and tinplate.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because cold forming adds internal stresses, annealing may be required to improve formability. 
        Although CR steel offers superior appearance and performance, the additional processing costs make 
        it best suited for applications where surface finish and tight tolerances are essential.
