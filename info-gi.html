        <h1>Galvanized Iron / Steel (GI)</h1>

        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Galvanization</strong> is the application of a protective zinc coating over steel or iron to prevent rust.
            In GI steel, the zinc layer shields the base metal in two ways: it provides a <strong>physical barrier</strong> 
            and offers <strong>sacrificial (cathodic) protection</strong> by corroding before the steel does.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most common production method is <strong>Hot-Dip Galvanizing (HDG)</strong>. The steel is thoroughly 
            cleaned and submerged into molten zinc at approximately <strong>450°C</strong>. During dipping, the coating 
            metallurgically bonds with the steel — creating strong <strong>zinc-iron alloy layers</strong> beneath a 
            pure zinc topcoat.
        </p>

        <p>
            As GI steel ages, the outer zinc slowly transforms into <strong>zinc carbonate</strong>, forming a stable, 
            self-protecting patina that significantly extends the product’s lifespan in outdoor environments.
        </p>

</div>

        <p>
            Even if the coating is scratched, adjacent zinc continues to corrode preferentially, 
            <strong>protecting exposed steel surfaces</strong>. This unique self-healing ability is what makes GI 
            a trusted solution in the construction and infrastructure sectors.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like all coatings, performance depends on coating thickness and environment — high temperatures or 
            aggressive chemicals may require careful specification and maintenance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Common uses include <strong>roofing sheets, wall claddings, roll-formed channels, fencing structures, 
            cable trays, guardrails</strong> and a wide range of utilities and accessories.

<h1>ZAM Steel (Zn-Al-Mg Coated Steel)</h1>

<div class="image-row">

</div>

<p>
    <strong>ZAM</strong> is an advanced metallic coating combining <strong>zinc, aluminum, and magnesium</strong>.
    It is engineered as a next-generation evolution of traditional galvanization, delivering superior corrosion
    resistance and longer coating life. In the coating, <strong>zinc</strong> supplies sacrificial protection,
    <strong>aluminum</strong> builds a durable physical barrier, and <strong>magnesium</strong> promotes stable
    corrosion products that slow degradation.
</p>

<p>
    Typical commercial ZAM compositions are roughly <strong>90–93% Zn, 5–8% Al, and 1–3% Mg</strong>. Even small
    percentages of magnesium noticeably improve performance in chloride-rich or coastal environments by forming
    protective magnesium-based corrosion films at damaged spots.
</p>

<p>
    ZAM is applied by a continuous hot-dip process similar to HDG, but with a Zn-Al-Mg bath and precise air-knife
    control. The result is a tough, self-healing coating that often outperforms GI and Aluzinc in long-term exposure tests.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    Recommended uses include <strong>coastal roofing, architectural cladding, solar module frames, cable trays,
    agricultural structures, and outdoor fixtures</strong> where long life and low maintenance are priorities.
</p>

<p>
    Limitations: ZAM requires attention to <strong>welding procedures</strong> (due to Mg), and performance can be
    reduced in very alkaline chemistries — specs should be checked with the mill for specialised applications.
